# Python-FlaskAPI-MovieDataset
"This dataset uses data from Kaggle"

This repository contains a Python Flask API that provides movie recommendations based on content filtering and demographic filtering techniques.

## Content Filtering

Content filtering is a technique that recommends movies based on their similarity to a given movie. The similarity is measured by comparing the genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview of the movies.

## Demographic Filtering

Demographic filtering is a technique that recommends movies based on their popularity and ratings. The popularity and ratings are weighted by the number of votes to avoid bias towards movies with few votes.
